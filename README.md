# Prendus Style Guide

### [Styling examples](https://prendus.github.io/style-guide/)

This style guide will be used to help guide the design of the [Prendus](https://prendus.com/) site.  We strive to be consistent, simple, and elegant.

**Please follow this style guide whenever possible** (it's usually possible).  Even if you disagree with the design, consistency is paramount to brand identity.  Refrain from adding custom CSS to change more than layout.  Sizes, colors, borders, padding, etc. should remain consistent across the site.

If styling for a certain element or feature is not mentioned here, follow [Google Material Design](https://material.google.com/) principles.  However, **if there is a conflict between Material Design and this guide, follow this guide.**

If you wish to contribute to the style guide, make a pull request and/or contact the styling lead (currently @intcreator).

## Including global styles

The Prendus CSS files are found in [intcreator/prendus-styles](https://github.com/intcreator/prendus-styles).  Include the component by running the following command in the same directory as bower.json:

```
$ bower install --save intcreator/prendus-styles
```

Import the component as needed with HTML imports.  If you're including styles on a static HTML page, you will have a `style` declaration that looks similar to this:

```html
<style is="custom-style" include="prendus-styles">

	/* styles */

</style>
```

If you're including styles in a Polymer element, you will have a `style` declaration that looks similar to this:

```html
<style include="prendus-styles">

	/* styles */

</style>
```

## Layout

Design all pages taking into consideration desktop and mobile usage.  Do not design for one before the otherâ€”design for both at the same time.

Before coding, make sketches of the basic layout (less than five minutes each) and show them to team members if not random people who match the site's audience to make sure the layouts make sense.

### Breakpoints

Prendus has the following breakpoints:

| Small Mobile | Mobile | Tablet | Desktop |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| < 500px | >= 500px | >= 768px | >= 992px |

Try to use as few explicit breakpoints as possible.  Instead of using media queries (`@media`), use `max-width` or other more automatic layout CSS.

### Containers

You can use default Prendus container classes to standardize the spacing between elements in containers and to cut down on element-specific CSS:

| Container type | Class |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| Horizontal | `prendus-horizontal-container` |
| Vertical | `prendus-vertical-container` |

Don't force the use of these container classes; rather use them to quickly add spacing to your elements.

### Cards

Cards can be used to make an element stand out from the background.  Prendus usually uses cards to feature the main content on a page (such as a course, quiz, question, etc.).

Polymer has a `<paper-card>` element, but use `<div class="prendus-card">` whenever possible.  The `<div>` is more lightweight and uses the same Material Design style to produce the depth effect.

Do not nest cards inside each other.  Limit the number of cards used on each page.

### Dialogs

Use the `<paper-dialog>` element.  Add content and buttons as follows:

```html
<paper-dialog>
	<div class="content">
		<h2>Reset Password</h2>
		<p>We'll send you an email with a link to reset your password</p>
	</div>
  <div class="buttons">
  	<button class="prendus-button" dialog-dismiss>Cancel</button>
  	<button class="prendus-button prendus-button--recommended" on-tap="sendEmail">Send</button>
  </div>
</paper-dialog>
```

Note the `<div class="content">`.  This is necessary to avoid a formatting issue caused by `<paper-dialog>`.

## Colors

Some colors are given variable names such as `--prendus-primary-color`.  Refer to these colors as `var(--prendus-primary-color)` as in the following example:

```css
background-color: var(--prendus-primary-color);
```

### Color Variables

| Color Name | Color Code | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Prendus Primary Color | `--prendus-primary-color` | For logos, headers, and primary actions buttons.  Use to make clear the primary identity of Prendus. |
| Prendus Primary Color Emphasis | `--prendus-primary-color-emphasis` | For accents and places where a color change on hover is needed (such as on buttons). |
| Prendus Primary Color Light | `--prendus-primary-color-light` | For light backgrounds that could use a touch of color (such as tabs). |
| Prendus Off White | `--prendus-off-white` | For backgrounds that should be light, but not plain white (such as cards, menus, highlights, etc.). |
| Prendus Grey | `--prendus-grey` | For outlines, dividers, and secondary buttons. |
| Prendus Green | `--prendus-green` | For signaling that an action is okay or announcing success. |
| Prendus Blue | `--prendus-blue` | For highlighting important information or quotes. |
| Prendus Yellow | `--prendus-yellow` | For warning the user about potential problems. |
| Prendus Red | `--prendus-red` | For announcing critical errors, and warning about destructive actions (see  `prendus-button--destructive`). |

## Buttons

Prendus buttons should be either `<a>` or `<button>` tags.  Get a second opinion before using another tag as a button.  The default anchor and button tags provide usability features that are not present on other tags.

Prendus buttons are stylized by adding the appropriate classes as follows:

### Generic buttons

| Button type | Description | Class to add |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Default | The base button class | `prendus-button` |
| Recommended | Used to recommend actions to the user | `prendus-button--recommended` |
| Minor | Used for closing dialogs or other small actions | `prendus-button--minor` |
| Destructive | Used to warn users that the action triggered by the button cannot be undone | `prendus-button--destructive` |
| Big | Used sparingly in calls to action (such as on the home page) | `prendus-button--big` |

### Link buttons

Link buttons are `<button>` elements that need to look like default `<a>` elements.  This is useful if you need to include button functionality inline in a body of text.  However, usually a generic button placed somewhere else will work better.

To create a link button, add the `prendus-link-button` class.

### Icon buttons

Icon buttons are primarily `<paper-icon-button>` elements that need to respond when the user hovers over them.  Avoid using `<iron-icon>` for button functionality (however, you should use `<iron-icon>` inside of `<a>` tags).

To create an icon button, add the `prendus-icon-button` class to one of the following:

- a `<paper-icon-button>` element
- an `<iron-icon>` element nested inside an `<a>` element

### How to use

If you are using a specific type of button (like a recommended action button) you need to include the base class (`prendus-button`) in addition to the specific class.  For example:

```html
<button class="prendus-button prendus-button--recommended">Sign up</button>
```

## Drop-downs

Drop-downs are used for menus and selecting items from a list.  Use a standard Prendus drop-down instead of `<paper-listbox>` or `<select>`.

### Generic drop-down

Basic drop-down syntax looks like this:

```html
<prendus-drop-down button-text="Menu" button-title="Profile and settings">
  <a href="#">Profile</a>
  <a href="#">Settings</a>
  <button on-tap="logOut">Log out</button>
</prendus-drop-down>
```

The generic drop-down has the following properties:

| Property | Description |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| button-text | The text displayed on the button that will be clicked to show the drop-down |
| button-type | The type of button to be shown (extends the `prendus-button--...` classes; pick `recommended`, `destructive`, etc.) |
| button-title | The text displayed when the user hovers the cursor over the button |
| button-icon | The icon displayed next to the button text (using the same text as the `icon` attribute in `<iron-icon>`) |
| horizontal-align | The alignment of the menu to the right or left side of the button (the only options are `right` and `left`) |
| responsive | Add if the menu should be responsive (show a menu icon instead of text on small screen sizes) |

Note: the drop-down will still function without any of these properties, but you should add enough to make the drop-down purpose clear and easy to use.
